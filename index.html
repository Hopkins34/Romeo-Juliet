                    <p class="Article__p">Planning a traditional Renaissance wedding in Verona, Italy, was an opportunity to immerse myself in the city’s historic charm and cultural richness. Verona’s timeless beauty, from its ivy-covered chapels and grand villas to its cobblestone streets, provided the perfect setting for a celebration steeped in romance. The city’s connection to Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet offered poetic inspiration, making it a meaningful choice for a union built on love. By incorporating Renaissance traditions, elegant attire, and symbolic rituals, I aimed to recreate the beauty and spirit of Verona’s golden age, capturing its essence in every detail.</p>

                    <p class="Article__p">Creating a 5-song soundtrack for an upcoming Romeo and Juliet film required deep thought about how to capture the story’s emotional depth and timeless themes.

                    <p class="Article__p">Defending the beauty and validity of Romeo and Juliet’s sudden love and marriage meant embracing the intensity and passion that define their story. Their love, though swift, reflects the unfiltered emotions of youth and the timeless idea that love defies logic and societal constraints. I argued that their connection wasn’t just impulsive but deeply poetic, symbolizing the purity of a bond untouched by prejudice or hatred. Their decision to marry quickly highlighted their commitment and courage, proving that even in a world divided by conflict, love can be a powerful and transformative force. Rather than dismissing their love as reckless, I celebrated it as a bold act of hope in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>
